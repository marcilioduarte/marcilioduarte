- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcilioduarte, I'm a economist by formation and currently I'm doing a specialization in Data Science & Analytics.
- 👀 As an economist, I’m interested in many topics in the economics fields, but the ones I like the most are the Economic Development and the Financial Market fields. 
     Nonetheless, in the field of Data Science & Analytics, besides the part of it applied to economics,
     I'm also interested in topics of the entertainment industry, such as the 
     Sports, E-sports and the Anime Industry. 
     Besides that, I'm also curious about the Turism Industry, specially when it comes to the Aviation & the Hotel markets.
- 🌱 As I said, I’m currently specializing in DS&A. For that reason, I'm currently learning Python, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, ETL, SQL & PowerBI. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project of DS&A that fit in the topics I've mentioned above.
