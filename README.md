👋 Hi, I’m @marcilioduarte. I have a degree in economics and currently work as a Data Analyst while specializing in Data Science as a graduate student (postgraduate for the British, lol).

👨🏾‍💻 Due to my job and studies, I have extensive experience extracting data using APIs and SQL, processing and analyzing it in Python using VSCode, and using ETL tools like Pentaho to upload data into databases such as MongoDB and Dbeaver (PostgreSQL) and create stage tables, data marts, and relationship schemas. Additionally, I can create beautiful and performative dashboards in Power BI. Some of the projects I worked on will be published on my Github portfolio, but most of them are company-private, so I can only show them in private talks.

🌱 As it is a requirement in the technology field, I'm always studying and open to learning new things.

👀 Regarding my personal skills, I'm a very communicative and hard-working person. Never giving up, paying attention to details, and always trying new ways to solve problems are a big part of who I am as a professional.

💞️ Furthermore, I'm interested in collaborating on various projects of many different study fields, such as Economic Development and Financial Markets or Aviation, Soccer, and the Anime industry, to name a few.
