# **👋 Hi, I’m Marcilio...**

and here are a few things about me:

🧑‍🎓 I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics and a postgraduate qualification in Data Science. Currently, I am employed as a Mid-Level Data Analyst.

👨🏾‍💻 Although I'm a Data Analyst/Scientist, my professional and academic experiences have provided me with a rich background in data engineering tasks. I have substantial expertise in extracting data via APIs, SQL, and in developing data pipelines for ETL processes. My preferred tools for these ETL processes are Python and Pentaho. Check this repository for an example: 

- [ETL](https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio-etl-automation)

📊 In the realm of data visualization, one of my notable projects is the "Identidades Territoriais" dashboard which I developed (and manage as P.O.) at my job using Power BI [Identidades Territorias Dashboard](https://www.inteligencia.sebraemg.com.br/painel/identidades-territoriais). Beyond Power BI, I have developed various other data visualization products.

🔍 As for my data science projects, you can check my DS portfolio on Hugging Face, Kaggle and GitHub:

- [Credit Worthiness Risk Classification](https://huggingface.co/spaces/marcilioduarte/Credit-Worthiness-Risk-Classification)
- [California Housing Prices - Manual Pipeline and Grid Search](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marcilioduarte/cali-h-p-lr-dt-and-rf-manual-pipe-and-grid)
- [Data Science and Analytics Portfolio](https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio-data-science-and-analytics/tree/main/completed)

More to come on this area.

🤖 One other thing about me is that recently I've developed a strong competency in building automation tools, particularly in creating robust web scraping bots for various functions, such as data downloading and inputting data on websites. The project bellow is an example: 
- [Automation bot](https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio-web-automation)

🌱 Staying true to the ever-evolving nature of the technology field, I'm always eager to study and open to learning new skills and technologies. For example, I am currently broadening my expertise by learning Java, CSS, and HTML. 

👀 Regarding my personal skills, I'm a very communicative and hard-working person. Never giving up, paying attention to details, and always trying new ways to solve problems are a big part of who I am as a professional.
