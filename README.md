👋 Hi, I’m @marcilioduarte. I hold a degree in economics and I'm currently working as a Data Analyst while specializing in Data Science as a graduate student (postgraduate for the British, lol).

👨🏾‍💻 My professional and academic experiences have provided me with a rich background in data engineering tasks. I have substantial expertise in extracting data via APIs, SQL, and in developing data pipelines for ETL processes. I frequently work with databases like MongoDB and Dbeaver (PostgreSQL) to create comprehensive star schemas, including stages, data marts, and fact tables. My preferred tools for these ETL processes are Python and Pentaho.

📊 In the realm of data visualization, I excel at creating insightful and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI. One of my notable projects in this domain is [Identidades Territoriais]([url](https://www.inteligencia-sebraemg.com.br/identidades-territoriais)), which showcases my skills in presenting complex data in an easily understandable format. Beyond Power BI, I have developed various other data visualization products. For example, you can view a project hosted on Heroku [here]([url](https://sebraemg-uine-adhoc01-5328a5782f7f.herokuapp.com/)).

🔍 For a deeper insight into my data science projects, you can explore my portfolio on GitHub. These include a variety of applications, such as [this one]([url](https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio/tree/main/completed/german_credit_risk_app)) and [this othe one]([url](https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio/tree/main/completed/house_prices)). These projects demonstrate my ability to handle complex data science tasks, from pre-processing to model development and deployment.

🤖 Recently, I've developed a strong competency in building automation tools, particularly in creating robust web scraping bots for various functions, such as data downloading and inputting data on websites. This experience has significantly expanded my skillset in automation and data handling.

🌐 I am currently broadening my expertise by learning Java, CSS, and HTML. This venture aims to develop comprehensive data intelligence products, encompassing everything from back-end development to hosting functional applications with an attractive front end.

🌱 Staying true to the ever-evolving nature of the technology field, I'm always eager to study and open to learning new skills and technologies.

👀 Regarding my personal skills, I'm a very communicative and hard-working person. Never giving up, paying attention to details, and always trying new ways to solve problems are a big part of who I am as a professional.

💞️ I am also interested in collaborating on various projects across diverse fields, including Economic Development, Financial Markets, Aviation, Soccer, and the Anime industry, to mention a few.
