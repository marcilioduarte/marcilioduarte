👋 Hi, I’m @marcilioduarte. I hold a degree in economics and I'm currently working as a Mid-Level Data Analyst while specializing in Data Science as a post-graduate student and here are a few things about me:

👨🏾‍💻 Although I'm a Data Analyst/Scientist, my professional and academic experiences have provided me with a rich background in data engineering tasks. I have substantial expertise in extracting data via APIs, SQL, and in developing data pipelines for ETL processes. I frequently work with databases like MongoDB and Dbeaver (PostgreSQL) to create comprehensive star schemas, including stages, data marts, and fact tables. My preferred tools for these ETL processes are Python and Pentaho.

📊 In the realm of data visualization, one of my notable projects is the "Identidades Territoriais" dashboard which I developed (and manage as P.O.) at my job using Power BI (https://www.inteligencia-sebraemg.com.br/identidades-territoriais). This project showcases my skills in presenting complex data in an easily understandable format. Beyond Power BI, I have developed various other data visualization products. For example, you can check a "mvp type" project hosted on Heroku here: https://sebraemg-uine-adhoc01-5328a5782f7f.herokuapp.com/

🔍 As for my data science projects, you can check my DS portfolio on Hugging Face, Kaggle and GitHub:

https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio-data-science-and-analytics/tree/main/completed

These projects demonstrate my ability to handle complex data science tasks, from pre-processing to model development and deployment. More to come on this area.

🤖 One other thing about me is that recently I've developed a strong competency in building automation tools, particularly in creating robust web scraping bots for various functions, such as data downloading and inputting data on websites. This experience has significantly expanded my skillset in automation and data handling. This project is also here on github: https://github.com/marcilioduarte/portfolio-web-automation

🌱 Staying true to the ever-evolving nature of the technology field, I'm always eager to study and open to learning new skills and technologies. For example, Right now I am currently broadening my expertise by learning Java, CSS, and HTML. 

👀 Regarding my personal skills, I'm a very communicative and hard-working person. Never giving up, paying attention to details, and always trying new ways to solve problems are a big part of who I am as a professional.
